How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

Lots of manul work has been avoided. Good to get used to it.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

We can rollback and analyze to whichever version we want and whenever we require.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros: Can avoid unnecessary commits and huge history.
Cons: Might miss the update details if commits NOT done at required timings.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Saving mulitple files is a better option for maintaining code programming.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
