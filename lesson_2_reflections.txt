ONce a considerable changes has been done to which we may need to rollback in future.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area offers to track and record the changes until a commit command is triggered.

HAHAHA

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By commiting the changes after each logical chnage has been performed. It can be done by adding the chnagesto staging and commiting the same.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
