What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

.git folder has been created.
ONce a considerable changes has been done to which we may need to rollback in future.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area offers to track and record the changes until a commit command is triggered.

HAHAHA

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By commiting the changes after each logical chnage has been performed. It can be done by adding the chnagesto staging and commiting the same.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

We can try to implement different ideas without losing the working version of the code. Different ideas can be organised as different branches.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Very well. I love the recent explanations on the branches.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

GIT's automatic merging is avoiding the incorrect guessing incase if the change is done on the same area. It is being stopped by throwing merge conflict.
Concern is the additional time we spend to work on these.
